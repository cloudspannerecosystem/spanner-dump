===

spanner-dump is a command line tool for exporting a Cloud Spanner database in text format.

Exported databases can be imported to Cloud Spanner with [spanner-cli](https://github.com/cloudspannerecosystem/spanner-cli).

```sh
# Export
$ spanner-dump -p ${PROJECT} -i ${INSTANCE} -d ${DATABASE} [table_name ...] > data.sql

# Import
$ spanner-cli -p ${PROJECT} -i ${INSTANCE} -d ${DATABASE} < data.sql
```

Please feel free to report issues and send pull requests, but note that this application is not officially supported as part of the Cloud Spanner product.

## Use cases

This tool can be used for the following use cases.

- Export a database in text format for testing purposes
- Export a database running on [Cloud Spanner Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/emulator)

For production databases, you should use an [officially-provided export](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/export),
which should be stable and much faster.

## Limitations

- This tool does not ensure consistency between database schema (DDL) and data. So you should avoid making changes to the schema while you are running this tool. 
- This tool does not consider data order constrained by [Foreign Keys](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview).
